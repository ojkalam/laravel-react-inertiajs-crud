# Project Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices to follow for this project, which uses Laravel, Inertia.js, and React.js.

## Laravel Best Practices

### Security
*   **Keep dependencies updated**: Always use the most recent stable release of Laravel and other dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches.
*   **Protect against vulnerabilities**: Use Laravel's built-in features to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. This includes using the `{{ }}` Blade syntax to escape output, including a CSRF token in forms, and using Eloquent ORM or the query builder to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Secure your environment file**: Never commit your `.env` file to a public repository and make sure it is not publicly accessible on your server. Also, disable debug mode in production.
*   **Use HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS to protect sensitive data transmitted between the client and the server.
*   **Validate and sanitize data**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious data from being processed.
*   **Use authorization**: Use policies and gates to control access to your application's resources.

### Performance
*   **Caching**: Cache routes, configuration, and views to improve your application's speed. You can also cache frequently executed queries.
*   **Optimize database queries**: Use eager loading to prevent the "N+1" query problem, and select only the columns you need from the database. Also, be sure to add indexes to frequently queried columns.
*   **Use queues**: For time-consuming tasks like sending emails, use queues to run them in the background and avoid blocking user requests.
*   **Optimize frontend assets**: Use tools like Laravel Mix to minify and bundle your CSS and JavaScript files.

### Code and Project Structure
*   **Follow conventions**: Adhere to Laravel's naming conventions for controllers, models, views, and database tables. Laravel follows the PSR-2 and PSR-4 coding standards.
*   **Fat models, skinny controllers**: Keep your controllers light by moving business logic into service classes and database-related logic into models.
*   **Use request classes for validation**: Instead of validating in the controller, use dedicated request classes to keep your controllers cleaner.
*   **Single responsibility principle**: Each class and method should have one, and only one, job.
*   **Don't repeat yourself (DRY)**: Avoid duplicating code by using things like Blade templates and middleware.
*   **Write tests**: Automated tests help you catch bugs early and ensure your application is working as expected.

## Inertia.js Best Practices

### Core Concepts
*   **Embrace the Monolith**: Inertia is designed to be a "modern monolith". This means you should leverage your server-side framework's (like Laravel, Ruby on Rails, or Django) features for routing, controllers, and data management.
*   **URL-Driven Navigation**: The URL should always represent the current state of your application. Use Inertia's `<Link>` component for navigation, which intercepts clicks and makes XHR requests instead of full page reloads.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Use Inertia's SSR capabilities to improve initial page load times and SEO. The server renders the initial HTML, and subsequent interactions are handled on the client-side.

### Performance Optimization
*   **Partial Reloads**: To optimize performance, use partial reloads to fetch only the data that has changed, instead of reloading all the data for a page. This is useful for things like filtering a list of users where you only need to update the user data, not the entire page.
*   **Lazy Data Evaluation**: Wrap optional page data in closures on the server-side. This ensures that data is only evaluated and included in the response when explicitly requested.
*   **Asset Versioning**: Keep your assets up-to-date by using Inertia's asset versioning feature. When an asset changes, Inertia will automatically perform a full-page visit to load the new asset.
*   **Link Prefetching**: For a faster user experience, you can prefetch the data for a page when a user hovers over a link.

### Data and Props
*   **Shared Data**: Share data that is needed on every page (like the authenticated user) using Inertia's `share` method on the server-side. This data will be automatically available as props in your client-side components.
*   **Prop Management**: Be mindful of the data you pass to your components. Only pass the data that is necessary for that component to render.

### Forms and Validation
*   **Form Handling**: Inertia simplifies form submissions. It treats form submissions like regular Inertia requests, which means you can use your existing server-side validation logic.
*   **Error Handling**: Validation errors are flashed to the session on the server and are automatically available as props on the client-side. For pages with multiple forms, use "error bags" to scope validation errors to a specific form.

### SEO and Meta Management
*   **Head Component**: Use the `<Head>` component to manage the page `<title>` and `<meta>` tags for better SEO. You can set default head elements in your layout and override them on individual pages.

## React.js Best Practices

### Component Design and Structure
*   **Keep Components Small and Focused**: Create components with a single responsibility. This makes them easier to understand, test, and reuse.
*   **Functional Components and Hooks**: Prefer functional components with Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) over class-based components. Hooks lead to more readable and concise code.
*   **Component Composition**: Break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. This improves modularity and separation of concerns.
*   **File Organization**: Keep related files together. A common practice is to place a component's JavaScript, CSS, and tests in the same directory. Name files and components using PascalCase (e.g., `ReservationCard.jsx`).

### State Management
*   **Localize State**: Keep state as close as possible to where it's used. Avoid lifting state unnecessarily.
*   **Use `useReducer` for Complex State**: For components with complex state logic, `useReducer` can be a better choice than `useState`.
*   **Context for Global State**: Use the Context API to share data that is considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user or theme. This helps avoid "prop drilling" (passing props through many levels of components).

### Performance Optimization
*   **Optimize Re-Renders**: Use `React.memo` for functional components and `PureComponent` for class components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Lazy Loading**: Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to split your code and only load components when they are needed. This can significantly improve initial load time.
*   **Memoization**: Use the `useMemo` hook to memoize expensive calculations so they are not re-executed on every render.
*   **Keys in Lists**: When rendering lists of elements, always use a stable and unique `key` for each item. Avoid using the array index as a key, as it can lead to performance issues and bugs.

### Coding Style and Conventions
*   **JSX Syntax**: Always use JSX syntax. Wrap multi-line JSX in parentheses for better readability.
*   **Props**: Use camelCase for prop names. Omit the value of a prop when it is `true`.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   Use PascalCase for component filenames and names (e.g., `MyComponent`).
    *   Use camelCase for instances of components (e.g., `myComponent`).
    *   Custom hooks should be prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useCustomHook`).
*   **Styling**: Avoid inline styles. Instead, use CSS-in-JS libraries or import stylesheets.
